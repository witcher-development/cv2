			<p>Hiring is a bit of a gamble for both sides. Let me try to make it less of a gamble for you.</p>
			<p>Here is the list of risks I'd be considering as a hiring person and I guess you do too.</p>
			<p>Let me answer them for you.</p>

			<ol>
				<li>
					<h4>Will he manage this job?</h4>
					<p><i>Most programming isn't rocket science. The hard part is communication and collaboration. You have a gap to close - I'll learn your approach, problems and the domain, and not only close the gap, but help you move faster.</i></p>
					<p>On my last job I landed as frontend developer into a startup, but ended up:</p>
					<ul>
						<li><p>Owning whole the full stack platform.</p></li>
						<li><p>Conducting the process of creating and enforcing conventions for the new code. With each task-related PR I migrated a part of old code to match those conventions too.</p></li>
						<li><p>In the absense of the team lead I took charge at a team mate's critical situation with a delivery of a time-pressured feature. I identified misalignments between the requirements and implementation, found a temporary technical mitigation, fixed communication and documented everything to get team lead up to speed with the situation.</p></li>
						<li><p>Fixing developer exprience and build times.</p></li>
						<li><p>Managed navigating in an unkown domain (cybersecurity) and producing code that reflects this domain well.</p></li>
					</ul>
				</li>
				<li>
					<h4>Does he have experience with technology X?</h4>
					<p>...</p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<h4>How long will it take for him to get up to speed?</h4>
					<p>Last time it took me 1 week to figure out the main things. It took me 1 month to fully get onboard, to start promoting code conventions, culture, and actively participate in improving it.</p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<h4>How does he take feedback?</h4>
					<p><i>I love feedback, I'm happy to learn that I'm wrong and I'm actively looking for feedback myself.</i><p>
					<p>On one of my previous jobs I had a one to one and got feedback that I need to be a more reliable team mate so that people are calm to skip manual testing of my PRs, because they are sure that I did my best. I still have it written down and use each PR as a chance to make people feel safe about my code.</p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<h4>How does he give feedback?</h4>
					<p>People say I'm pretty good at it :)</p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<h4>Is he code-oriented or problem-oriented?</h4>
					<p><i>I love solving problems. Code is just one way to sovle it. Honestly, the less code is required to solve a problem - the happier I am, because it's less to maintain</i></p>
					<p>An example when understanding of the environment and the problem helped me to write less code and move on to the next problem faster:</p>
					<p>We needed to dynamically identify meta data to a piece of content. Think of it as tags for articles. The proposed solution was to research for a 3rd party service which would give us a DB of tags and give set of tags per article. I suggested we just create a hardcoded table of tags and whenever we don't have a tag for article we mark it in the DB and manually process (create new tag and assign to acricle) which took much less time and worked great for a startup without clients.</p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<h4>Does he require micromanagment?</h4>
				</li>
				<li>
					<h4>Will he bring something new to the table?</h4>
					<p><i>I have an active life, many interests and 8 years of experience in the field behind me. There is a big chance that my background + your background would be a cool combo.</i></p>
						PUT PERSONALIZATION HERE. BASED ON COMPANY
				</li>
				<li>
					<h4>Will he contribute to the things outside of his direct tasks?</h4>
					<p><i>GENERAL POINT ABOUT COMPANY SUCCESS</i></p>
					<p>A few cool things I did on previous jobs:</p>
					<ul>
						<li><p>Orginized a knowledge-sharing meetup at a local cafe.</p></li>
						<li><p>Writted down most of the team's decisions and outcomes of them.</p></li>
						<li><p>Leveraged "Why we do this?" question.</p></li>
					</ul>
				</li>
				<li>
					<h4>How does he operate in low-certainty environment?</h4>
					<p><i>No one has all answers. If all details are figured out already - problem is already solved and I'm not needed there.</i></p>
					<p>My last job is a low-certainty environment, because it's a startup. We had to operate with low amount of info, make very high-level decisions and figure out together.</p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<h4>Is he autonomous?</h4>
					<p>----stick to process, keep people in loop, give estimate and update when it changes, find issues, write them down and solve whatever else fits into the same scope, have question - ask, need help - let know.----</p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<h4>Can we rely on his honest opinion during a crisis?</h4>
					<p>When I work on a project I think of it as my own project that I do with my partners. Of course I would address a risk for my own project to my partners.</p>

			<h3 class="title">Achievements/Cool things I did</h3>
			<ol>
				<li>
					<h5>Saved company money on (not) hiring a backend dev.</h5>
					<p class="subtitle">Luchs, Fullstack Engineer</p>

					<p>I landed as a frontend developer and slowly took over the backend part of the platform which allowed the team lead to focus on his responsibilities and illiminated the need to hire a backend developer for the company.</p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<h5>Saved the day which let us do a demo for investor.</h5>
					<p class="subtitle">Luchs, Fullstack Engineer</p>

					<p>The situation: (emoji exaggeration is intended for fun)</p>
					<ol style="font-size: 12px;">
						<li>
							<p>We have an investor demo in a week. ü§Ø</p>
						</li>
						<li>
							<p>The dev went down the rabbit hole writting core of the feature we presenting. üòµ‚Äçüí´    </p>
						</li>
						<li>
							<p>Secondary things (UIs, endpoints, etc) were not started yet. ü¶ø</p>
						</li>
						<li>
							<p>Requirements and expectations were miscommunicated and misinterpreted. ü§ê</p>
						</li>
						<li>
							<p>Team Lead is on vacation. üå¥</p>
						</li>
						<li>
							<p>I was busy with other things and just got involved. üßê</p>
						</li>
					</ol>

					<p>How I solved it:</p>
					<ol style="font-size: 12px;">
						<li>
							<p>I went through the existing implementation with the dev, then through the requirements with CTO.</p>
						</li>
						<li>
							<p>I proposed the changes to the scope to make it feasible, but still viable.</p>
						</li>
						<li>
							<p>Helped with the implementation.</p>
						</li>
						<li>
							<p>Documented all the story to onboard the Team Lead when he is back.</p>
						</li>
					</ol>

					<!-- <p>In the absense of the team lead I took charge at a team mate's critical situation with a delivery of a time-pressured feature. I identified misalignments between the requirements and implementation, found a temporary technical mitigation, fixed communication and documented everything to get team lead up to speed with the situation when he came back.</p> -->
				</li>
				<li>
					<h5>Fixed developer experience on frontend on my own initiative.</h5>
					<p class="subtitle">Luchs, Frontend Developer (before started working with backend too)</p>
					<p>We had a crazy-slow Webpack config, old TS version and no linting rules.</p>
					<p>I handled these topics one by one starting with a prototype in my free time, selling it to the team, implementing the full version and documenting it.</p>
					<p>I led the conversation about the ESLint rules and found a balance of strictness to fit our team best.</p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<h5>Promoted our culture and technical/communicational best practices.</h5>
					<p class="subtitle">Luchs, Frontend Developer (before started working with backend too)</p>

					<p>I completely onboarded with the way we work within 1 month. A part of the team that was there before me and was falling behind on the values and approach. That was causing inefficiencies and conflicting situations, but I advocated for the values we agreed on and was bringing up problematic situations for a balanced team-level discussion.</p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<h5>Pushed the discussion of the codebase architecture and gradually rewrote the codebase.</h5>
					<p class="subtitle">Luchs, Frontend Developer (before started working with backend too)</p>

					<p>There was a messy startup's codebase which started suffering from lack of structure. I pushed the topic, prepared a few drafts, conducted the discussion and gradually rewrote most of codebase to match the new achitecture.</p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<h5>Produced a high-quality codebase with a commitment to represent the real world nature of cybersecurity.</h5>
					<p class="subtitle">Luchs, Fullstack Engineer</p>

					<p>I came in with zero knowledge of cybersecurity and had to create the frontend of a related platform. With each new feature I commited into understanding of the nature of underlying processes to represent them in the codebase. The resulting codebase is split into modules representing real entities from the domain and is very consistent in using patterns.</p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<h5>Leaded the innovation into the application core to make it more futureproof in the rapidly changing environment.</h5>
					<p class="subtitle">Pouch, Frontend Developer</p>

					<p>The main product of a company was a browser extension which relied on a functionality that was later announced to be disabled. As an attempt to keep us floating technology-wise I created a JSON-based language and the engine to run it. It supposed to let us continue operate via a loophole in the new rools.</p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<h5>Mothballed codebase covering it with tests and documentation when startup closed.</h5>
					<p class="subtitle">Luchs, Fullstack Engineer</p>

					<p>The time has came to close the startup I worked in, but founders had plans for the codebase. It might be relaunched with new team later, so we did our best covering everything with tests and docs for the next engineers who gonna work on it.</p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<h5>Games in Vue.</h5>
					<p class="subtitle">LastMarket, Frontend Developer</p>
					<p>Not proud of that, but it was games for an online casino. They were quite different, but pretty basic.</p>

			<p>
				### Luchs (June 2023 - June 2024)

				*Cybersecurity startup from Israel. 4 people in total.*

				- React app with MUI and Python (FastAPI) on backend. Postgres + TortoiseORM.
				- Couched CTO frontend.
				- Iterated on features together with CTO.
				- Brought code quality on the next level.
				- Took charge of the platform.
				- Took charge of a critical situation in absence of Team Lead to save investors demo.
				- Addressed misalignments, highlighted risks, maintained the culture.
				- Mothballed codebase covering it with tests and documentation when startup closed.

				### My own marketplace startup (January 2023 - May 2023)

				I didn't reach far, but better understood the complexity and what I'm missing.

				Participated in events for startup founders, made connections, made market research, researched target audience’s experience, was getting feedback from other founders.

				The only piece of code I wrote is a crawler for competitor websites to get some insights. Gathered ~15GB of data.

				### Contractbook (June 2021 - December 2022)

				*SaaS startup from Denmark. Entered a new cross-functional product team as 3rd member. 4 devs, 2 QA, UX, Team Lead, PM*

				- Big React app transitioning from JS to TS. All new code in TS. Redux and redux-observable. Started playing with Immer closer to the end. Elixir on Backend - made small changes.
				- When the team was not full yet I was helping another team with some pages + scrolling animation
				- Home page - dashboard/hub page.
				- Refactored a huge slice of old JS and Redux code to TS to enable the next iteration *(on my own, rest with the team)*
				- Redesign of the Templates page
				- Workspaces feature for the Templates page.
				- Quite a complex multi-step multi-select component to invite people. Based on React Select, but hugely modified. We’ve done it as an autonomous sub-project together with another dev and UX designer testing a new iteration each hour.
				- Started permissions project. Mostly discovery process and a lot of technical designing sessions resulting in a strongly typed system.
				- High-level kanban, but for each sub-project each sub-team was deciding how to work on their own
				- Really appreciate the awesome workshops we had led by Youenn (Team Lead) and sessions with Monika (QA Team Lead).

				### Pouch/Requestum (January 2020 - June 2021)

				*Requestum is a Ukrainian software house, Pouch is a UK product startup building a browser extension*

				For a month or 2, I worked on internal projects:

				- File sharing app. Prototype using native JS (blob). Took over the work of a senior dev and continued alone.
				- React + TS + CSS app using Leaflet in a team with one backend/data engineer.
				- Maintenance and small adjustments to a React CRM with a team of devs (3-4) and a PM. Agile

				The rest of the time I was outsourced to be a part of the Pouch product team:

				- Browser extension using VueJS for UI and a custom event-driven framework in TS for logic. Mostly new features: user account, redesign, etc.
				- A lot of online shops reverse-engineering to make our extension run there using custom JS puppeteer-like scripts
				- Was creating a JSON-based instructions language and engine for it to enable new features and improve DX of creating those custom scripts
				- Agile

				### LastMarket (June 2019 - January 2020)

				*An online casino in Russia. 2 people team - me and a PHP dev/team lead*

				- New games for the casino written in VueJS + Nuxt + CSS. Without canvas, pure HTML divs. Animations using keyframes and sprites

				- Work with Page Builder with some custom JS in WP in 1 on 1 with a client from US
				- Close cooperation with a QA person to make a lot of fixes in React and CSS.

				### Digital Mind (June 2017 - January 2018)

				*3 people digital studio in Ukraine*

				- HTML+CSS responsive layouts
				- Maintenance of VueJS + PHP website
				- The first meeting with Git
