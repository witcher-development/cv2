			<p>Hiring is a bit of a gamble for both sides. Let me try to make it less of a gamble for you.</p>
			<p>Here is the list of risks I'd be considering as a hiring person and I guess you do too.</p>
			<p>Let me answer them for you.</p>

			<ol>
				<li>
					<h4>Will he manage this job?</h4>
					<p><i>Most programming isn't rocket science. The hard part is communication and collaboration. You have a gap to close - I'll learn your approach, problems and the domain, and help you move faster.</i></p>
					<p>On my last job I landed as frontend developer into a startup, but ended up:</p>
					<ul>
						<li>Fixing developer exprience and build times.</li>
						<li>Conducting the process of creating and enforcing conventions for the new code. With each task-related PR I migrated a part of old code to match those conventions too.</li>
						<li>In the absense of the team lead I took charge at a team mate's critical situation with a delivery of a time-pressured feature. I identified misalignments between the requirements and implementation, found a temporary technical mitigation, fixed communication and documented everything to get team lead up to speed with the sutiation.</li>
						<li>Managed navigating in an unkown domain (cybersecurity) and producing code that reflects this domain well.</li>
					</ul>
				</li>
				<li>
					<h4>Will he bring something new to the table?</h4>
					<p><i>I have an active life, many interests and 8 years of experience in the field behind me. There is a big chance that my background + your background would be a cool combo.</i></p>
						PUT PERSONALIZATION HERE. BASED ON COMPANY
				</li>
				<li>
					<h4>Does he have experience with technology X?</h4>
					<p>...</p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<h4>How long will it take for him to get up to speed?</h4>
					<p>Last time it took me 1 week to figure out the main things. It took me 1 month to fully get onboard, to start promoting code conventions, culture, and actively participate in improving it.</p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<h4>How does he take feedback?</h4>
					<p><i>I love feedback, I'm happy to learn that I'm wrong and I'm actively looking for feedback myself.</i><p>
					<p>On one of my previous jobs I had a one to one and got feedback that I need to be a more reliable team mate so that people are calm to skip manual testing of my PRs, because they are sure that I did my best. I still have it written down and use each PR as a chance to make people feel safe about my code.</p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<h4>How does he give feedback?</h4>
					<p>People say I'm pretty good at it :)</p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<h4>Will he contribute to the things outside of his direct tasks?</h4>
					<p><i>GENERAL POINT ABOUT COMPANY SUCCESS</i></p>
					<p>A few cool things I did on previous jobs:</p>
					<ul>
						<li>Orginized a knowledge-sharing meetup at a local cafe.</li>
						<li>Writted down most of the team's decisions and outcomes of them.</li>
						<li>Leveraged "Why we do this?" question.</li>
					</ul>
				</li>
				<li>
					<h4>How does he operate in low-certainty environment?</h4>
					<p><i>No one has all answers. If all details are figured out already - problem is already solved and I'm not needed there.</i></p>
					<p>My last job is a low-certainty environment, because it's a startup. We had to operate with low amount of info, make very high-level decisions and figure out together.</p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<h4>Is he code-oriented or problem-oriented?</h4>
					<p><i>I love solving problems. Code is just one way to sovle it. Honestly, the less code is required to solve a problem - the happier I am, because it's less to maintain</i></p>
					<p>An example when understanding of the environment and the problem helped me to write less code and move on to the next problem faster:</p>
					<p>We needed to dynamically identify meta data to a piece of content. Think of it as tags for articles. The proposed solution was to research for a 3rd party service which would give us a DB of tags and give set of tags per article. I suggested we just create a hardcoded table of tags and whenever we don't have a tag for article we mark it in the DB and manually process (create new tag and assign to acricle) which took much less time and worked great for a startup without clients.</p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<h4>Does he require micromanagment?</h4>
				</li>
				<li>
					<h4>Can we rely on his honest opinion during a crisis?</h4>
					<p>When I work on a project I think of it as my own project that I do with my partners. Of course I would address a risk for my own project to my partners.</p>
