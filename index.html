			<p>Hiring is a bit of a gamble for both sides. Let me try to make it less of a gamble for you.</p>
			<p>Here is the list of risks I'd be considering as a hiring person and I guess you do too.</p>
			<p>Let me answer them for you.</p>

			<ol>
				<li>
					<h4>Will he manage this job?</h4>
					<p><i>Most programming isn't rocket science. The hard part is communication and collaboration. You have a gap to close - I'll learn your approach, problems and the domain, and not only close the gap, but help you move faster.</i></p>
					<p>On my last job I landed as frontend developer into a startup, but ended up:</p>
					<ul>
						<li><p>Owning whole the full stack platform.</p></li>
						<li><p>Conducting the process of creating and enforcing conventions for the new code. With each task-related PR I migrated a part of old code to match those conventions too.</p></li>
						<li><p>In the absense of the team lead I took charge at a team mate's critical situation with a delivery of a time-pressured feature. I identified misalignments between the requirements and implementation, found a temporary technical mitigation, fixed communication and documented everything to get team lead up to speed with the situation.</p></li>
						<li><p>Fixing developer exprience and build times.</p></li>
						<li><p>Managed navigating in an unkown domain (cybersecurity) and producing code that reflects this domain well.</p></li>
					</ul>
				</li>
				<li>
					<h4>Does he have experience with technology X?</h4>
					<p>...</p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<h4>How long will it take for him to get up to speed?</h4>
					<p>Last time it took me 1 week to figure out the main things. It took me 1 month to fully get onboard, to start promoting code conventions, culture, and actively participate in improving it.</p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<h4>How does he take feedback?</h4>
					<p><i>I love feedback, I'm happy to learn that I'm wrong and I'm actively looking for feedback myself.</i><p>
					<p>On one of my previous jobs I had a one to one and got feedback that I need to be a more reliable team mate so that people are calm to skip manual testing of my PRs, because they are sure that I did my best. I still have it written down and use each PR as a chance to make people feel safe about my code.</p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<h4>How does he give feedback?</h4>
					<p>People say I'm pretty good at it :)</p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<h4>Is he code-oriented or problem-oriented?</h4>
					<p><i>I love solving problems. Code is just one way to sovle it. Honestly, the less code is required to solve a problem - the happier I am, because it's less to maintain</i></p>
					<p>An example when understanding of the environment and the problem helped me to write less code and move on to the next problem faster:</p>
					<p>We needed to dynamically identify meta data to a piece of content. Think of it as tags for articles. The proposed solution was to research for a 3rd party service which would give us a DB of tags and give set of tags per article. I suggested we just create a hardcoded table of tags and whenever we don't have a tag for article we mark it in the DB and manually process (create new tag and assign to acricle) which took much less time and worked great for a startup without clients.</p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<h4>Does he require micromanagment?</h4>
				</li>
				<li>
					<h4>Will he bring something new to the table?</h4>
					<p><i>I have an active life, many interests and 8 years of experience in the field behind me. There is a big chance that my background + your background would be a cool combo.</i></p>
						PUT PERSONALIZATION HERE. BASED ON COMPANY
				</li>
				<li>
					<h4>Will he contribute to the things outside of his direct tasks?</h4>
					<p><i>GENERAL POINT ABOUT COMPANY SUCCESS</i></p>
					<p>A few cool things I did on previous jobs:</p>
					<ul>
						<li><p>Orginized a knowledge-sharing meetup at a local cafe.</p></li>
						<li><p>Writted down most of the team's decisions and outcomes of them.</p></li>
						<li><p>Leveraged "Why we do this?" question.</p></li>
					</ul>
				</li>
				<li>
					<h4>How does he operate in low-certainty environment?</h4>
					<p><i>No one has all answers. If all details are figured out already - problem is already solved and I'm not needed there.</i></p>
					<p>My last job is a low-certainty environment, because it's a startup. We had to operate with low amount of info, make very high-level decisions and figure out together.</p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<h4>Is he autonomous?</h4>
					<p>----stick to process, keep people in loop, give estimate and update when it changes, find issues, write them down and solve whatever else fits into the same scope, have question - ask, need help - let know.----</p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<h4>Can we rely on his honest opinion during a crisis?</h4>
					<p>When I work on a project I think of it as my own project that I do with my partners. Of course I would address a risk for my own project to my partners.</p>

			<h3 class="title">Achievements/Cool things I did</h3>
			<ol>
				<li>
					<h5>Saved company money on (not) hiring a backend dev.</h5>
					<p>I landed as a frontend developer and slowly took over the backend part of the platform which allowed the team lead to focus on his responsibilities and illiminated the need to hire a backend developer for the company.</p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<h5>Saved the day which let us do a demo for investor.</h5>
					<p>In the absense of the team lead I took charge at a team mate's critical situation with a delivery of a time-pressured feature. I identified misalignments between the requirements and implementation, found a temporary technical mitigation, fixed communication and documented everything to get team lead up to speed with the situation when he came back.</p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<h5>Fixed developer experience on frontend on my own initiative.</h5>
					<p>We had a crazy-slow Webpack config, old TS version and no linting rules.</p>
					<p>I handled these topics one by one starting with a prototype in my free time, selling it to the team, implementing the full version and documenting it.</p>
					<p>I had to fix ~1k liting errors to intruduce the new ESLint config.</p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<h5>Promoted our culture and technical/communicational best practices.</h5>
					<p>I completely onboarded with the way we work within 1 month. A part of the team that was there before me and was falling behind on the values and approach. That was causing inefficiencies and conflicting situations, but I advocated for the values we agreed on and was bringing up problematic situations for a balanced team-level discussion.</p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<h5>Pushed the discussion of the codebase architecture and gradually rewrote the codebase.</h5>
					<p>There was a messy startup's codebase which started suffering from lack of structure. I pushed the topic, prepared a few drafts, conducted the discussion and gradually rewrote most of codebase to match the new achitecture.</p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<h5>Produced a high-quality codebase with a commitment to represent the real world nature of cybersecurity.</h5>
					<p>I came in with zero knowledge of cybersecurity and had to create the frontend of a related platform. With each new feature I commited into understanding of the nature of underlying processes to represent them in the codebase. The resulting codebase is split into modules representing real entities from the domain and is very consistent in using patterns.</p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<h5>Leaded the innovation into the application core to make it more futureproof in the rapidly changing environment.</h5>
					<p>The main product of a company was a browser extension which relied on a functionality that was later announced to be disabled. As an attempt to keep us floating technology-wise I created a JSON-based language and the engine to run it. It supposed to let us continue operate via a loophole in the new rools.</p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<h5>Mothballed codebase covering it with tests and documentation when startup closed.</h5>
					<p>The time has came to close the startup I worked in, but founders had plans for the codebase. It might be relaunched with new team later, so we did our best covering everything with tests and docs for the next engineers who gonna work on it.</p>
				</li>
			</ol>

			<h3 class="title" style="margin-top: 30px;">Technologies I have experience with</h3>
			<ol>
				<li>
					<h5>Frontend stack</h5>
					<p>JS/TS, styling, React, other frameworks and ecosystem. HTMX.</p>

					<h5>Python, Golang</h5>
				</li>
				<li>
					<h5>SQL/NoSQL DBs</h5>
				</li>
				<li>
					<h5>E2E Tests (Playwright)</h5>
